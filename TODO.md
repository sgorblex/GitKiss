- better check for ssh pubkey validity
- set some fallback mechanism for when commands are not run by the shell
- check for unnecessary arguments in commands (check arg number prior to executing the verbs)
- alphabetic storage of admins and users for access for binary search
- make everything work with names containing spaces (except users: those should be checked not to have spaces)
