- better check for ssh pubkey validity
- set some fallback mechanism for when commands are not run by the shell
- check for unnecessary arguments in commands (check arg number prior to executing the verbs)
- alphabetic storage of admins and users for access for binary search
- make everything work with names containing spaces (except users: those should be checked not to have spaces)
- substitute `if [ ! -d "$repo_path" ]` with a library function `isRepo(user, reponame)`
- flag to make every repo accessible by the owner, another flag for admins (?). Should this also give permission to manage?
- implement key command
- implement repo limits
- write way better code
- write code documentation
- write user documentation
- implement the rest of repo ls
