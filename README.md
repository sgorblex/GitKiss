# GitKiss

## Installation
...
...
- in the openssh server settings (usually `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) set `PermitUserEnvironment` to `GK_*`. Might be subject to changes.
- abilitate git-daemon
- eventually, `touch ~/.hushlogin`

## Contribute
- I like clean code! Make a pr if you think some part can be better written (very possible)
